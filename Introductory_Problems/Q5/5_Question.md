## Permutations
A permutation of integers 1,2,\ldots,n is called beautiful if there are no adjacent elements whose difference is 1.
Given n, construct a beautiful permutation if such a permutation exists.

## Input
The only input line contains an integer n.
### Input:
5

## Output
Print a beautiful permutation of integers 1,2,\ldots,n. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. If there are no solutions, print "NO SOLUTION".
### Output:
4 2 5 3 1 

## Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 10^6

## Weird Algorithm
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:
 * 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 

## Input:
3

## Output:
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

## Constraints  
1 <= n <= 10^6

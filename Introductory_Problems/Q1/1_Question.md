# Collatz Sequence Simulation

* Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:  
$$ 3 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1$$  
Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.  

## Input:
3

## Output:
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

## Constraints  
1 <= n <= 10^6
